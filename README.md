# Convoy SC-7 Analysis

## Objective
This project is a comprehensive, multi‑faceted after‑action report for Convoy SC‑7 (October 1940), undertaken from the perspective of a Royal Navy officer who served in the Battle of the Atlantic. The aim is to apply a modern, disciplined analytical framework—using a GitHub repository as a “digital war room”—to examine the tactical challenges faced during this critical convoy battle.

## Structure
The analysis is broken into four distinct investigative areas, each developed in its own branch and merged through a formal review process:

1. **Escort Composition & Capabilities** – Ships, armament, command structure, and operational limitations.
2. **Attacking U‑boat Wolf‑pack** – Identification of U‑boats involved, their tactics, coordination, and the “wolf‑pack” concept.
3. **Chronological Timeline of Events** – Hour‑by‑hour reconstruction of the convoy’s passage, contact reports, attacks, and losses.
4. **Impact of Weather & Technology** – Influence of Atlantic weather, visibility, radio‑interception, radar, and ASDIC (sonar) performance.

## Methodology
- Each area is treated as a separate GitHub issue.
- For each issue a feature branch is created containing a dedicated Markdown file with researched data and analysis.
- A pull request is opened for each branch, including a self‑review comment that cross‑references sources and highlights key findings.
- Pull requests are squashed and merged into `main`, building the final report incrementally while maintaining a clean commit history.

## Sources
- Admiralty War Diaries and after‑action reports.
- U‑boat KTB (Kriegstagebücher) logs.
- Published histories and memoirs of participants.
- Meteorological records for the North Atlantic, October 1940.

## Outcome
A structured, version‑controlled after‑action report that can be reviewed, expanded, and used as a reference for historical analysis of convoy warfare in the early stages of the Battle of the Atlantic.
